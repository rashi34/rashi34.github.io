This blog post contains a tutorial for constructing an interesting data visualization of the [Palmer Penguins](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins) data set. 

## Getting Started
First, import the data. 
```python
# Importing the data
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```
Next, clean the data as needed. I cleaned the 'Species' column of the data so that only each penguin's species (and no other information) will be included in each row. For example, in one row the penguin's species is listed as 'Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)'. The code below clean the text to just 'Adelie'. 
```python
# Cleaning the 'Species' column
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)
```

## Making the Graph
The code below will create a scatter plot of penguin culmen length against culmen depth, color coded by penguin species. To do this, each penguin species in the data will be iterated through, with each species's culmen length and culmen depth being plotted in a unique color. Next, a table legend, axis labels, and title will be created, and then your graph is done! Yay!

```python
# Creating the graph
fig, ax = plt.subplots(1)
# List of species to iterate through and use to index the data
species = set(penguins['Species'])
for s in species:
    # Index data by penguin species
    i = penguins[penguins['Species'] == s]
    # Plot the culmen length and culmen depth for each specific species
    ax.scatter(i['Culmen Length (mm)'], i['Culmen Depth (mm)'], label = s)
# Create a legend, axis labels, and title for the graph
ax.legend()
xy = ax.set(xlabel = 'Culmen Length (mm)', ylabel = 'Culmen Depth (mm)')
l = fig.suptitle('Culmen Depth and Culmen Length by Species', fontsize=15)
```
